# Predictive Modeling on Customer Spending

This project applies numeric prediction techniques to build a predictive model for customer spending predictions. The dataset contains data about whether or not different consumers made a purchase in response to a test mailing of a certain catalog and, in case of a purchase, how much money each consumer spent.

## Approach
- Predictive Modeling, Data Processing
- Model(s) used: Linear Regression, k-NN, Regression Tree, SVM Regreesion, Neural Network and Ensembling Models
- Evaluation metrics

## Business Value
The final model may be selected base on different business context. With the final model, businesses can achieve the following:
- Evaluate the effectiveness of certain test-mailing or campaign
- Predict the quantified result

## Artifacts
- Notebook: [notebooks/predictive_modeling_on_customer_spending.html](notebooks/predictive_modeling_on_customer_spending.html)
